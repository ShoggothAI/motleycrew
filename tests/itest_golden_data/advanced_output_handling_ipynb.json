The algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated for each element in the list, with each pass moving the next largest element to its correct position. The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list, and the inner loop runs `n-i-1` times, where `i` is the current pass number. An optimization is added to exit early if no swaps are made during a pass, indicating that the list is already sorted. This ensures that the algorithm does not perform unnecessary passes, improving efficiency. The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, making it inefficient for large datasets."
